CountAnything
=============
**[Project homepage](https://github.com/raphaelr/countanything)**

This is a generic counting application. It allows the user to have a counter. Which counts. It's that simple. It was designed for the [speedrunning community](http://speedrunslive.com). If you see [tape1](http://twitch.tv/tape1) streaming, say hi!

Configuration
-------------
Self-explanatory. Click on the colored boxes to change the color, and on the font field to change the font.

The "Format" option allows you to change the way the text is displayed. For example, if you set it to "{0} of {1}", the counter would display "15 of 60" instead of "15/60". For more information on what you can use in the format box, [go here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/txafckwd.aspx).

Compiling
---------
Open the solution in Visual Studio 2010 and press "F6". Or use MSBuild.

Installation
------------
None. Extract the executable somewhere and you're ready to go.
